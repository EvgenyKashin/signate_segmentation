# Signate segmentation
My solution for [AI Edge Contest (Segmentation Division)](https://signate.jp/competitions/143) - (22 from 402 participants with 0.652 IoU).

## Data
The training data for training segmentation models consist of 2,243 images, test - 649. Images have resolution of 1936 x 1216.
Categories utilized for submission evaluation (totally 20 categories):
- car
- pedestrian
- signal
- lane.

Notebook with [EDA](https://github.com/EvgenyKashin/signate_segmentation/blob/master/EDA.ipynb).

## Model
I'm tried Unet with different pretrained backbones. For validation, train dataset was splitted on 7 folds
statified by route category and time of day. Notebook with model's [errors analysis](https://github.com/EvgenyKashin/signate_segmentation/blob/master/Error_analysis.ipynb).

### Methods
- Train on crops (256px, 512px, 768px); predict on full, predict on crops, predict on crops with intersection.
- Train on resized (50%, 75% of original size); predict on full, predict on resized + bilinear upsampling.
- Train on full size; predict on full size - **best score**.
- Train on all categories (not only on 4); predict 4 categories.

### What is implemented
- learning rate scheduling
- early stopping
- different backbones (ResNet family + WideResnet)
- different loss functions (bce, jaccard, focal)
- a lot more (see train.py input args)

### What didn't work
- [In-place activated batchnorm](https://github.com/mapillary/inplace_abn) - doesn't reduce memory usage too much
- [fp16 training](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) - it's really free a lot GPU memory and you can use bigger batch size,
but for me it doesn't converges to good results (yep, I tried dynamic_loss_scale=True)

### TODO
- strong image augmentations
- one cycle learning rate
- snapshot ensembling + folds ensembling
- se, scSE blocks in decoder
- TTA
- linkNet
- pseudo labeling

### Training
Best model was trained on full size images with batch size = 3 on Titan V CEO edition (with 32 Gb memory). 
Training was on all 20 categories with bce loss for 20 epochs (12 hours).

Top image - raw, middle - ground true, bottom - model prediction.
